PaaS is a type of service that is designed to offer platforms that simplify development processes. 
It offers a customizable but integrated environment and workflow on top of the infrastructure layer 
so that developers can use the platformâ€™s tools and APIs without complicated setup or expensive 
resources. These services also offer easy scalability since they have the resources available for 
expanding compute, storage, and networking as applications grow. These platforms allow for easy 
monitoring of performance and provide a variety of data and logs to help with development.

In addition to infrastructure and runtimes, PaaS often includes built-in services such as managed
databases, authentication systems, messaging services, and automated scaling. Many providers also 
integrate testing and debugging tools, continuous deployment pipelines, and frameworks for common 
programming languages, which reduces the need for teams to manage separate toolchains. A graphical 
dashboard or console is typically provided so that developers can manage applications, resources, 
and scaling visually, in addition to command-line or API access.

These tools are useful in CI/CD-driven cloud development because they greatly reduce the testing, 
integration, and deployment times for code. By abstracting away the underlying infrastructure, 
PaaS solutions allow developers to push changes that are automatically built, tested, and deployed 
into standardized environments. This ensures consistency between development, staging, and production, 
minimizes manual configuration errors, and speeds up release cycles. As a result, teams can deliver 
new features and fixes more quickly, respond to user feedback in near real time, and maintain higher 
software quality with less operational overhead.
